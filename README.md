# CPyOS
CircuitPythonOS, explains itself. If you want your app added to the official repository (https://github.com/Marko2155/CPyOS), just submit a pull request.
If errors appear while using it, check if there is a patch or an update for CPyOS and install it, or just close or restart the device. 

# How to install
Just install CircuitPython on your board, and replace the default code.py, with the code.py in this repo.
Oh, and the libraries too. Install circup, and do this command: `circup install adafruit_display_text` with your board plugged in.
